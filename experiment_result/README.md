This directory contains IOR experiment results using POSIX, MPI-IO, and HDF5 APIs for various access patterns in different sub-directories:

# aggregate_performance
This directory includes aggregated bandwidth of baseline, blocks, and collective experiments.

# file_open_close
This set of experiment results compares the Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of file open and close time of different APIs with various number of nodes (2, 8, 32, 128).

# collective
This set of experiment results compares the CDF from each MPI ranks in different access patterns.
